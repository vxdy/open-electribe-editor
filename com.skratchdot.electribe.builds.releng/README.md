For the build file to work, you will need to copy and rename
the following 2 files:

  1. copy: build.credentials.properties.example and rename it to: build.credentials.properties
  2. copy: build.properties.example and rename it to: build.properties

Then login to Google Code to get your password:

  https://code.google.com/hosting/settings

Enter the correct settings in your build.credentials.properties file.
